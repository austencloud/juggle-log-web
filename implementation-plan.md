## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migration Strategy
```typescript
// Migration from localStorage to Supabase
class DataMigration {
  async migrateUserData(userId: string) {
    const localData = this.getLocalStorageData(userId);
    
    // Migrate personal records
    await this.migratePersonalRecords(userId, localData.progress);
    
    // Migrate gamification data
    await this.migrateGamificationData(userId, localData.gamification);
    
    // Migrate achievements
    await this.migrateAchievements(userId, localData.achievements);
    
    // Keep localStorage as backup during transition
    this.markMigrationComplete(userId);
  }
}
```

### Pattern Notation Integration
```typescript
// Dual notation support
interface PatternInput {
  customNotation?: string;
  siteswapNotation?: string;
  description?: string;
  difficulty?: number;
}

class PatternService {
  async submitPattern(input: PatternInput): Promise<Pattern> {
    // Validate both notations if provided
    if (input.customNotation) {
      this.validateCustomNotation(input.customNotation);
    }
    
    if (input.siteswapNotation) {
      this.validateSiteswap(input.siteswapNotation);
    }
    
    // Auto-convert if only one notation provided
    if (input.customNotation && !input.siteswapNotation) {
      input.siteswapNotation = this.convertToSiteswap(input.customNotation);
    }
    
    return this.createPattern(input);
  }
}
```

### Video Verification Workflow
```typescript
interface VerificationWorkflow {
  submission: RecordSubmission;
  autoChecks: AutoVerificationResult;
  communityVotes: VerificationVote[];
  moderatorReview?: ModeratorReview;
  finalStatus: 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'pending';
}

class VerificationService {
  async processSubmission(submission: RecordSubmission): Promise<VerificationWorkflow> {
    // Automated checks
    const autoChecks = await this.runAutoVerification(submission);
    
    // If auto-checks pass, open for community voting
    if (autoChecks.passed) {
      await this.openCommunityVoting(submission);
    }
    
    // Monitor voting progress
    return this.trackVerificationProgress(submission.id);
  }
}
```
