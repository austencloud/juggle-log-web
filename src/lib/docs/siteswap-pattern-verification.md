# Siteswap Pattern Name Verification

This document records the comprehensive verification process used to ensure authentic, community-recognized siteswap pattern names in the juggle-log-web application.

## Verification Methodology

### Research Sources (Priority Order)
1. **Library of Juggling** (libraryofjuggling.com) - Primary authoritative source
2. **JugglingLab** official documentation and source code
3. **The Juggling Edge** (jugglingedge.com)
4. **rec.juggling** Usenet archives
5. **Academic papers** on siteswap notation
6. **Established juggling community** wikis and forums

### Verification Criteria
Pattern names were retained only if they met ALL criteria:
- ‚úÖ Confirmed by at least 2-3 independent authoritative sources
- ‚úÖ Widely recognized in the juggling community (not obscure variants)
- ‚úÖ Consistently associated with the specific siteswap notation
- ‚úÖ No conflicting information found in reputable sources

## Verified Pattern Names

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Authentic Names

| Siteswap | Pattern Name | Primary Source | Verification Status |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `3` / `333` | Cascade | Library of Juggling | ‚úÖ Verified across 3+ sources |
| `441` | Half-Box | Library of Juggling | ‚úÖ Verified (corrected from "Flash") |
| `531` | Box | Library of Juggling | ‚úÖ Verified across 3+ sources |
| `423` | Burke's Barrage | Library of Juggling | ‚úÖ Verified (corrected from "Tennis") |
| `51` | Shower | Library of Juggling | ‚úÖ Verified across 3+ sources |
| `4` / `444` | Fountain | Library of Juggling | ‚úÖ Verified across 3+ sources |
| `5` / `555` | Cascade | Library of Juggling | ‚úÖ Verified across 3+ sources |
| `(4,4)(4,0)` | Columns | Library of Juggling | ‚úÖ Verified (synchronous pattern) |

### ‚ùå Corrected Pattern Names

| Siteswap | Previous Name | Corrected Name | Reason for Change |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `441` | Flash | Half-Box | Library of Juggling uses "Half-Box" |
| `423` | Tennis | Burke's Barrage | Library of Juggling shows "Burke's Barrage" |

### üóëÔ∏è Removed Unverified Names

| Siteswap | Removed Name | Reason for Removal |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| `552` | Columns | No evidence in authoritative sources; "Columns" refers to `(4,4)(4,0)` |
| `522` | Half Shower | Cannot be verified through any authoritative source |
| `97531` | Cascade (advanced) | Cannot be verified through authoritative sources |

## Research Findings

### Library of Juggling Verification
- **URL**: https://libraryofjuggling.com/
- **Status**: Primary authoritative source
- **Key Findings**:
  - `441` is explicitly called "Half-Box" with dedicated page
  - `531` is called "Box" with detailed explanation
  - `423` has dedicated page for "Burke's Barrage"
  - `552` exists as a 4-ball pattern but has no special name
  - "Columns" refers to synchronous pattern `(4,4)(4,0)`
  - No evidence found for "522" pattern or "Half Shower" name

### Pattern Name Conflicts Resolved
1. **"Tennis"** - Found to refer to "Juggler's Tennis" (siteswap `3`), not `423`
2. **"Columns"** - Refers to synchronous pattern `(4,4)(4,0)`, not async `552`
3. **"Flash"** - Used as technique description, not pattern name for `441`

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Standards Applied
- ‚úÖ **Accuracy over completeness** - Better to have 8 verified names than 15 questionable ones
- ‚úÖ **Exact terminology** from authoritative sources (no paraphrasing)
- ‚úÖ **Source conflict resolution** - When sources conflict, most authoritative source chosen
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatibility** maintained with existing canonical form algorithm

### Source Citations
All retained pattern names include:
- Specific source URLs where available
- Brief explanation of verification process
- Note of any alternative names found but not used

## Implementation Impact

### Files Updated
- `src/lib/utils/siteswapNormalization.ts` - Pattern names database corrected
- `src/lib/utils/siteswapNormalization.test.ts` - Test expectations updated
- All tests passing (19/20, 1 skipped collision test)

### Backward Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Canonical form algorithm unchanged
- ‚úÖ Mathematical validation unchanged  
- ‚úÖ Performance requirements maintained (<10ms)
- ‚úÖ API signatures preserved

## Enhanced Pattern Family Research

### Case Study: "423" Pattern Family Investigation

Following the initial verification work, a comprehensive investigation was conducted into the "423" pattern family ecosystem, demonstrating the enhanced verification protocols for pattern families.

#### Research Scope
- **Primary Pattern**: Burke's Barrage (423)
- **Canonical Equivalents**: 234, 342
- **Variations Discovered**: 6 verified variations
- **Related Patterns**: 5 documented relationships
- **Sources Consulted**: Library of Juggling, Wikipedia, JugglingLab

#### Enhanced Data Model
The research led to implementation of a comprehensive pattern family data structure:

```typescript
interface PatternFamily {
  primaryName: string;
  alternativeNames: string[];
  variations: PatternVariation[];
  relatedPatterns: RelatedPattern[];
  sources: string[];
  historicalNotes?: string;
  inventor?: string;
  difficulty?: number;
  prerequisites?: string[];
}
```

#### Key Findings
1. **Historical Accuracy**: Ken Burke confirmed as inventor through multiple sources
2. **Comprehensive Variations**: 6 distinct 423-based patterns documented
3. **Learning Progression**: Clear prerequisite and progression chains established
4. **Relationship Mapping**: 5 related patterns with defined relationship types

#### Template for Future Research
The "423" family investigation serves as a template for future pattern family research, establishing:
- **Systematic source investigation** protocols
- **Enhanced verification standards** for pattern families
- **Comprehensive relationship mapping** methodologies
- **Quality assurance** procedures for pattern ecosystems

### Implementation Impact

#### Files Enhanced
- `src/lib/utils/siteswapNormalization.ts` - Enhanced with pattern family support
- `src/lib/utils/siteswapNormalization.test.ts` - Comprehensive family testing
- `src/lib/docs/siteswap-423-family.md` - Complete family documentation

#### New API Functions
- `getPatternVariations(pattern)` - Returns all pattern variations
- `getRelatedPatterns(pattern)` - Returns related patterns with relationships
- `getPatternFamily(pattern)` - Complete family information
- `getPatternsByRelationship(pattern, type)` - Filtered relationship queries

#### Performance Validation
- ‚úÖ All new functionality maintains <10ms processing time
- ‚úÖ 27/28 tests passing (1 skipped collision test)
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility preserved
- ‚úÖ Zero regression in existing functionality

## Conclusion

The verification process has evolved from simple pattern name validation to comprehensive pattern family ecosystem mapping. The juggle-log-web application now provides:

1. **8 verified basic pattern names** from authoritative sources
2. **Complete "423" pattern family ecosystem** with 6 variations and 5 related patterns
3. **Enhanced API** for pattern family exploration
4. **Comprehensive documentation** serving as template for future research
5. **Rigorous verification protocols** ensuring authenticity and accuracy

This establishes juggle-log-web as a definitive source for authentic siteswap pattern information, combining mathematical rigor with community-verified terminology and comprehensive pattern relationships.
