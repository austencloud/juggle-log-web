# Juggling World Records Platform - Project Summary

## Project Vision

Transform the existing juggle-log-web application from a personal practice tracker into **the definitive, centralized platform for juggling world records** with mandatory video verification, while preserving all existing personal tracking functionality as a core subset.

## Research Findings Summary

### Existing Landscape Analysis

#### Primary Data Sources Identified:
1. **Juggle Wiki (Fandom)** - Most comprehensive public database
   - 600+ documented world records across all categories
   - Community-maintained with video verification requirements
   - Structured data suitable for import
   - CC-BY-SA licensing allows data usage with attribution

2. **The Juggling Edge** - Active community platform
   - Extensive personal and world records database
   - Real-time submissions from competitive jugglers
   - Detailed siteswap and trick-specific records
   - Partnership opportunity for data sharing

3. **International Jugglers' Association (IJA)** - Official organization
   - Competition records and standards
   - Potential for official platform recognition
   - Limited public database access

4. **Academic Research** - James Cozens (Cambridge University)
   - Cutting-edge siteswap tracking software
   - Computer vision for pattern recognition
   - Potential technical collaboration opportunity

### Key Technical Insights

#### Current System Strengths:
- Modern SvelteKit architecture (scalable)
- Comprehensive gamification system
- Multi-user support with data isolation
